# Legacy Documentation

This folder contains outdated documentation that is no longer actively maintained.
These were originally created by the Plato project and may not reflect the current state of Cadmus.

## Current Documentation

All current documentation has been moved to the [`docs/`](../docs) folder. 

## Migration Plan

The files in this folder will be gradually migrated to the `docs/` folder and updated to reflect current functionality.
During this transition period, please check both locations:

1. **First**, check the [`docs/`](../docs) folder for the latest information
2. **Only if not found there**, refer to files in this legacy folder
