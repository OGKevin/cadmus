# Documentation Review Guidelines (Contributors)

## Audience

Documentation in `contributing/` is for **developers and contributors** who are working on Cadmus.
Technical terminology is appropriate here.

## Tone and Language

- **Clear and direct** - Get to the point quickly
- **Technical terms OK** - Use standard development terminology (CI/CD, artifacts, deployment, configuration)
- **Assume technical knowledge** - Readers should understand Git, GitHub Actions, development workflows
- **Still avoid unnecessary complexity** - Technical doesn't mean obtuse

## Clarity and Structure

- Use short paragraphs and bullet lists
- Include code examples where helpful
- Link to relevant technical resources
- Explain architectural decisions when relevant
- Document setup steps precisely

## Content Focus

- Development environment setup
- Build and test procedures
- Architecture and design decisions
- Contribution workflows
- Internal tooling and scripts

## Formatting

- Format Markdown with Prettier
- Ensure Markdown passes markdownlint
- Use code blocks with language tags
